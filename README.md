During my second year of Holberton School, I dived into Machine Learning, a part of computer programming concerning algorithms that can improve themselves by means of experience and data. We covered the three major parts of Machine Learning, as well as doing a bit of math.

Below are the key folders of this repository:

## [Supervised_Learning](https://github.com/faspen/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/supervised_learning)

Supervised Learning concerns algorithms that learn to classify data by learning from *labeled* data. Here we learned about things like keras, transformers, and recurrent neural networks.

## [Unsupervised_Learing](https://github.com/faspen/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/unsupervised_learning)

Unsupervised Learning is all about models that organiza and classify data be studying *unlabeled* data. In this area of Machine Learning, we learned about dimensionality reduction, clustering (my favorite), and autoencoders.

## [Reinforcement_Learning](https://github.com/faspen/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/reinforcement_learning)

Reinforcement Learning trains models (or agents) to make specific decisions. These decisions are made by rewarding the agent for picking from the best options and learning from them. So far, we've only covered Q-learning, which is one of Reinforcement Learning's most basic concepts.

## Challenges

Machine differences were the big one here. Running the same code on different machines was prone to giving different outputs, which made finding a main platform to use rather difficult at times. Much like my Higher Level Programming project you can visit [here](https://github.com/faspen/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming), the installation of pip packages were an occassional challenge.
